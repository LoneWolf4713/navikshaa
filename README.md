### Tech Stack Used -> 
#### Python -> Flask REST API for backend, with strong authentication made possible with JSON Web Tokens.
#### JavaScript -> For Frontend Manipulation and Fetch API Calls
#### HTML, CSS, Bulma -> For UI / UX

### Flow -> 
#### The Workflow is simple, User Comes at index.html -> goes to login / signup page -> makes an account (at this stage, username and his details are stored in cookies, so no need to enter username again while booking a slot) -> slot booking / cancelling page.
